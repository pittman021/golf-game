# 3D Golf Game

A realistic 3D golf game built with JavaScript and Three.js.

## Features Implemented

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Complete golf gameplay with realistic physics
- Two-phase shot system:
  - Power meter phase for determining shot strength
  - Accuracy bar phase for shot precision
- Different club types (driver, iron, wedge, putter) with unique characteristics
- Club-specific accuracy profiles affecting shot success
- Wind system with variable direction and speed affecting ball flight
- Ball physics including gravity, wind effects, terrain collision, bounce, and roll
- Shot trajectory prediction and visualization that updates based on club selection and aim
- Stroke counting and par tracking
- Persistent game state saving and loading
- Score tracking across multiple holes
- Hole completion detection and automatic progression

### Terrain & Environment
- Procedurally generated 3D terrain with hills and undulations
- Multiple surface types affecting ball physics:
  - Fairway - medium friction
  - Rough - high friction
  - Green - low friction for putting
  - Bunkers - sand traps with unique physics
  - Tee box - starting area
- Proper collision detection with terrain
- Trees and other obstacles
- Realistic lighting with directional and ambient lights for proper shadowing
- Dynamic flag with physics-based animation responding to wind
- Flag and hole with accurate collision detection
- Gradient skybox for realistic environment

### Camera System
- Dynamic camera that follows the ball during shots
- Smart positioning based on aiming direction when not moving
- Smooth transitions between camera positions
- Automatically enters aiming mode when ball stops moving
- Free-roam camera mode for course exploration (press 'C')

### User Interface
- Game information panel showing:
  - Current hole and par information
  - Stroke count
  - Distance to pin
  - Wind speed and direction indicator with color coding
- Club selection interface with visual feedback
- Dynamic power meter with:
  - Color gradient visualization
  - Ideal power indicator suggesting optimal power for current club and distance
- Accuracy bar with club-specific accuracy zones:
  - Perfect zone (green) for ideal shots
  - Okay zones (yellow) for slightly compromised shots
  - Bad zones (red) for poorly executed shots
- Interactive scorecard showing:
  - Per-hole scores
  - Score relative to par
  - Total score
  - Current hole highlighting
- Hole selection interface for quick navigation
- Game completion modal with final score summary
- Restart options for current hole or entire game

### Technical Features
- Three.js 3D rendering engine
- Modular code structure with separate modules for:
  - Physics
  - Terrain generation
  - Camera control
  - Models and 3D objects
  - User interface
  - State management
- Optimized rendering with proper use of Three.js features
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Debug mode for development and testing
- Physics precomputation for more accurate trajectory predictions
- Local storage for game state persistence
- Automatic state saving every 30 seconds

## Controls
- Space: Start power meter → Release to enter accuracy phase → Press again to take shot
- Arrow Keys (Left/Right): Adjust aim direction
- Club Selection: Click on driver, iron, wedge, or putter buttons
- Shift: Enter explicit aiming mode (optional)
- C: Toggle free-roam camera mode
- S: Toggle scorecard
- R: Restart current hole
- Shift + R: Restart entire game

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient trajectory calculation that only updates when necessary
- Conditional UI updates to minimize DOM manipulations
- Throttled wind updates to reduce unnecessary redrawing
- Optimized physics calculations with cache for club distances
- Proper object cleanup and management to prevent memory leaks
- Efficient state management with minimal localStorage operations

## Future Development
- Multiplayer support
- Improved graphics and effects
- Sound effects and music
- Statistics tracking
- Mobile touch controls
- Customizable golf balls and clubs
- Tournament mode
- Course editor
- Weather effects
- Replay system
